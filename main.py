    ## Introduction:
    Imagine you are a **requirement analyst** working on defining stakeholders and end users for the given problem statement. Your goal is to identify all individuals or groups who interact with or are impacted by this system.

    ## Problem Statement:
    {problem_statement}

    To build this system efficiently, we need to first **identify key stakeholders and end users**.

    ## Task:
    - Identify and categorize **all relevant stakeholders** interacting with or impacted by the system.
    - Differentiate between **primary end users** (direct users) and **secondary stakeholders** (indirectly affected users).

    ## Instructions:
    1. **Classify stakeholders** into **primary (direct users)** and **secondary (indirect users)**.
    2. For each category, provide:
    - Their **role** in using or managing the system.
    - Their **expectations and concerns** about the system.
    3. Identify **any potential conflicts** between stakeholders and suggest how they can be resolved.
    4. Consider **external regulatory bodies** if applicable.

    ## Closing:
    Now that we have identified the key stakeholders and end users, the next step is to **apply elicitation techniques** such as **interviews, surveys, and observations** to gather detailed insights. This will help refine the system requirements and ensure it meets user needs effectively.

    1. Review each validated user story and assign a priority level based on the MoSCoW method:
    - Must-have (M): Essential for core system functionality; required in the first release.
    - Should-have (S): Important but not immediately necessary; can be implemented in a later phase.
    - Could-have (C): Enhances user experience or efficiency; beneficial but not critical.
    - Wonâ€™t-have (W): Not required for this release; can be reconsidered in future updates.

    2. Justify each classification based on the following factors:
    - Business Value: How critical is this feature to end users and stakeholders?
    - Urgency: Does this feature need immediate implementation?
    - Feasibility: How complex is the technical implementation?
    - Security & Compliance: Does this impact data protection or legal regulations?
    - Performance & Usability: Will this affect system efficiency and user experience?

    ---

    Example Prioritization:

    User Story:
    "As a passenger, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my account securely."

    MoSCoW Classification:
    - **Priority:** Must-have (M)
    - **Justification:**
    - Business Value: Essential for authentication and security (5/5).
    - Urgency: Required before any other feature (5/5).
    - Feasibility: Well-established implementation methods (5/5).
    - Security & Compliance: High (5/5) due to user credential protection.
    - Performance & Usability: Low impact on system performance (4/5).
    - Dependencies: Required for all account-related features (5/5).

    - **Resolution Strategy:**
    - Provide a feasible solution that aligns with business objectives and technical constraints.

    ### Example Conflict Resolution

    #### **EPIC: Secure User Access**
    - **Conflicting User Stories:**
    - _As a passenger, I want to log in using biometric authentication so that I can access my account quickly._
    - _As an admin, I want strict two-factor authentication so that unauthorized users cannot access the system._
    - **Conflict Type:** Security vs. Usability
    - **Conflict Analysis:**
    - Biometric authentication improves user experience but may not meet regulatory security requirements.
    - Two-factor authentication enhances security but may cause friction for frequent passengers.
    - **Resolution Strategy:**
    - Implement **adaptive authentication**, where high-risk actions require 2FA while low-risk logins allow biometrics.

    ### Instructions:
    1. Identify **three EPICs** where conflicts exist.
    2. Clearly describe the **conflict type and analysis** of the problem.
    3. Propose **practical resolution strategies** to balance competing requirements.
